## Westpoint Terrace Health and Safety Plan
###### Last updated June 23, 2021

Our guest suite health and safety plan is based on guidance from BC's Provincial Health Officer and WorkSafeBC.

#### Illness Policy
Owners and their guests are not permitted in the guest suite if the following apply:
* You have travelled outside of Canada—or had close contact (less than 2 metres apart for 15 minutes or more) with anyone that has travelled outside of Canada—in the past 14 days.
* You have had close contact with anyone with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in the past 14 days.
* You have a fever.
* You are experiencing new or worsening symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat; runny nose, sneezing or post-nasal drip (not related to allergies); hoarse voice; difficulty swallowing; loss of smell or taste; nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain; unexplained fatigue/malaise; chills or headache.

#### Our commitment to your health and safety
To create a safe environment for building residents and their guests, we have implemented the following protocols:
* Social distancing. Please maintain proper social distance in all common areas of the building. Masks or face coverings are recommended.
* Personal safety. Owners and guests have access to hand sanitizer. Please wash your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces.
* Ventilation. Consider opening the bedroom window and the patio door, and bathroom fan, to improve ventilation while you are inside of the suite.
* Enhanced cleaning. We provide cleaning products for you to regularly clean and sanitize the suite during your stay. Owners are accountable for thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the suite at the end of the stay and submitting the cleaning declaration to strata council.
* Staggered stays. We have created a 24-hour buffer period after each stay as an additional safety precaution.
* Contact tracing. A guest attendance record is kept should contact tracing be necessary. Owners are responsible for contacting the Property Manager, if required.

#### Call 8-1-1 if you have any health concerns or questions regarding possible COVID-19 symptoms.
