## Health and Safety Plan
###### Last updated July 31, 2022

My guest suite health and safety plan is based on guidance from BC's Provincial Health Officer and WorkSafeBC.

#### Illness Policy
Friends and Family are not permitted if the following apply:
* You have had close contact with anyone with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in the past 14 days.
* You have a fever.
* You are experiencing new or worsening symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat; runny nose, sneezing or post-nasal drip (not related to allergies); hoarse voice; difficulty swallowing; loss of smell or taste; nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain; unexplained fatigue/malaise; chills or headache.

#### My commitment to your health and safety
To create a safe environment for my friends and family, I have implemented the following protocols:
* <strong>Social distancing.</strong> Please maintain proper social distance in all common areas of the building. Masks or face coverings are recommended.
* <strong>Personal safety.</strong> You will have access to hand sanitizer. Please wash your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces.
* <strong>Ventilation.</strong> Consider opening the bedroom window and the patio door, and bathroom fan, to improve ventilation while you are inside of the suite.
* <strong>Enhanced cleaning.</strong> We provide cleaning products for you to regularly clean and sanitize the suite during your stay. Please thoroughly clean and sanitize the suite at the end of the stay.
* <strong>Contact tracing.</strong> A guest attendance record is kept should contact tracing be necessary.

#### Call 8-1-1 if you have any health concerns or questions regarding possible COVID-19 symptoms.
