excerpt: Website development
---
Over two weeks, I worked side-bu-side with the client [Naturopathic Alliance](https://naturopathicalliance.org/) to build and deploy a new website to support their efforts to dispel the Info-demic during the S SARS-CoV-2 virus.
A Wordpress instance, on a dedicated VM hosted in Google cloud was stood-up. The themes and CMS authoring tools requested were installed and the sites security and peeformance was optimized.
