mBibe.gifts is the unique way for adults to send a “cheers” via iMessage Chat.

* Friends use mBibe.gifts to connect with friends, when they just can’t make that awesome party that everyone else did. Send them a beer - to say “I’m there with you in spirit”!
* Or use mBibe.me to says thanks to colleagues that went above and beyond. Nothing says “You did a great job - way to rock it!” like a glass of wine or a fine cocktail.
* Reward coaches, cleaners, anyone with the mBibe.me app, and say “I appreciate you, thanks!” With mBibe.gifts, you can easily congratulate your friends, family, and colleagues with a digital gift of money, and a recommendation of a nearby bar to enjoy it. mBibe is a free App in the iTunes App Store and charges a small service fee for each gift that is sent. The mBibe.me App is a game-changer for anyone who has ever said ...

> Thanks, I owe you a beer!
