A role-playing game is an interactive story like a novel or a movie — except the actions of the players change the course of the adventure. The players interact with the universe through imaginary extensions of themselves called characters. These characters are people living in the Universe that the players control. Unlike regular games, RPGs change each time you play because the story is separate from the rules, so each time you use a new story the adventure changes. With role-playing games you never have the same adventure twice. That is what makes role-playing such a vivid, exciting and unique experience — you never know what to expect.
