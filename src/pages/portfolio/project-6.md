A guest suite booking site, for a local Strata (Condo) corporation. This is an example of a white lable knock-off of AirB&B, or MrBnB. 
The booking is done via a white label rooms booking service out of Germany [Beds24.com](https://Beds24.com) which is highly configurable. The Landing page displays the booking interface via an iframe and is hosted by [https://netlify.com](Netlify.com) via a Static Site Generator #SSG and at the edge via cloud content distribution network #CDN.
