A guest suite booking site, for a local Strata (Condo) corporation. This is an example of a White Lable knock-off of AirB&B, or Mr.BnB. 
The booking is done via a white label Hotel Booking Service out of Germany [Beds24.com](https://Beds24.com) which is highly configurable. The Landing page displays an iFrame and is hosted in by [https://netlify.com](Netlify.com) via a Static Site Generator and at the edge via cloud CDN.
