My first client & portfolio item using a new pattern of Web Development - JAMStack. This site was created usign Templates from [Stackbit.com](https://Stackbit.com) built on [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with the markdown and YAML files stored as a [GitHub](https://github.com/donnay/perpetual-sparrow) Repo, built on demand and when a commit is made to the Preview branch - the Site is generated and deployed to the cloud CDN by [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) 
The Shopping cart and e-commerce functions are delivered via [Shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com/). 
This pattern & combination of services produces a lighting fast, secure and responsive e-commerce web site. The content is managed via a GUI for easy site & store updates. 

>"Basically all the traditional monolithic CMS’s have really started seeing that this decoupling [of frontend from backend] is a reality and it’s desirable for the developers," - Matt Biilmann told  [thenewstack.io in Jul 2020](https://thenewstack.io/why-netlify-is-tech-agnostic-and-its-role-in-jamstack-development/?utm_source=robertjacobi)
