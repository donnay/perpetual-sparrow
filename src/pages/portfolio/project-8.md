My first portfolio project using the 'JAMStack'. Which is a pattern of just Javascript, APIs, and Markup to develop websites that are lightning fast, secure and responsive. The content is managed via a GUI for easy updates. 

This site was created using templates from [Stackbit.com](https://Stackbit.com) built on [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with the markdown and YAML files stored as a [GitHub](https://github.com/donnay/perpetual-sparrow) repo, built on demand and when a commit is made. 
#
[The site](https://www.discourse.org/)  is generated and deployed to the cloud CDN by [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/). 
#
The community chat is hosted [Discourse](https://forum.discourse.org/) on a VM in Google cloud.
